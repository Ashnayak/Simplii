| -------------- | ---------- |----------|
| Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... | 3 | All contributors have made significant commits in the codebase. [contributor stats](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/graphs/contributors)|
| But nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)	evidence in GH| 3 | https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/pulse |

| DOI badge: | 3 | Present in [README.md](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/README.md |
| Docs: doco generated , format not ugly| 3 | [README.md](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/README.md) [Installation/Testing guide](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/Installation.md)|
| Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)| 3 | [README.md](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/README.md) |
| Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z doc page entries | 3 | [README.md](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/README.md)|
| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing	| 3 | [README.md](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/README.md)|
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|	3 | [README.md](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/README.md) |
| Use of version control tools| 3 | GIT was used thorougly througout the project |
| Use of style checkers	| 2 | |
| Use of code formatters.| 3 | [pylint](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) [Evidence](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/docs/lintingEvidence/app.pyLinting.png) |

| other automated analysis tools | 1 | |
| test cases exist | 3 |  |
| test cases are routinely executed	| 3 | https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/.github/workflows/python-app.yml |
| the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up | 2 | https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md |	
| issues are discussed before they are closed | 3 | all the issues were discussed in a group and then one person was assigned for the closure |
| Chat channel: exists	| 3 | https://discord.gg/jFWP5v2C |
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases. | 3 | if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files	| 3 | We can clearly see that entire codebase has been written in Python(https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/search?l=python) and JavaScript(https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/search?l=javascript). Everyone has the same access to the repository and also have equal access to comitting directly to the main branch.|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)	| 3 | |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | [contributor stats](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/graphs/contributors) |
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base	| 3 | [contributor stats](https://github.com/ivbhatt/Simplii/graphs/contributors) |
| short release cycles | 3 | We had two major releases and committed the code regularly so that everyone was up to date. |
