| Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z doc page entries | 3 | |
| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing	|0| evidence|
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|	0| evidence|

| other automated analysis tools | 3 | evidence|
| test cases exist | 3 | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base |
| test cases are routinely executed	| 3 | |
| the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up |0| evidence|	
| issues are discussed before they are closed | 3 | all the issues were discussed in a group and then one person was assigned for the closure |
| Chat channel: exists	| 3 | https://discord.gg/jFWP5v2C |
